During this process, you've become more familiar with the particular idiosyncrasies of the dataset. This gives you an opportunity to uncover difficulties and potential pitfalls in working with the dataset as well as potential avenues for feature engineering that could improve the predictive performance of your model down the line. Remember that this is also not a linear process; after building an initial model, you might go back and continue to mine the dataset for potential inroads to create additional features and improve the model's performance if the initial results did not satisfy your needs and expectations.
